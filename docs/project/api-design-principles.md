# API Design Principles

## Overview
This document outlines the core design principles that guide the development of the Wandr backend API, ensuring a cohesive, scalable, and user-friendly travel platform.

## Core Principles

### 1. Travel-First Design
Every API endpoint should prioritize the travel use case and user journey:
- **Location-aware**: APIs should leverage geographic context
- **Client-optimized**: Responses optimized for various client bandwidth and offline scenarios
- **Real-time capable**: Support for real-time updates (notifications, booking changes)
- **Collaborative**: Enable social features and group travel planning

### 2. Developer Experience (DX)
The API should be intuitive and productive for both internal and external developers:
- **Self-documenting**: Comprehensive OpenAPI documentation with examples
- **Consistent patterns**: Predictable naming conventions and response structures
- **Type-safe**: Strong typing with Pydantic models and clear schemas
- **Error-friendly**: Meaningful error messages with actionable guidance

### 3. Performance & Scalability
Design for scale from the beginning:
- **Efficient pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Selective loading**: Field selection and resource embedding options
- **Caching strategy**: Appropriate cache headers and ETags
- **Rate limiting**: Fair usage policies to prevent abuse

### 4. Security by Design
Security considerations integrated into every endpoint:
- **Authentication required**: Default to authenticated endpoints
- **Authorization granular**: Resource-level permissions and role-based access
- **Data validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Privacy-conscious**: Minimal data collection and clear data handling

## Travel API Philosophy

### Location-Centric Architecture
The Wandr API is built around the concept that location context enhances every travel interaction:

```python
# Location context in search
GET /api/v1/destinations?near=48.8566,2.3522&radius=50km

# Location-aware recommendations  
GET /api/v1/recommendations?lat=48.8566&lng=2.3522&type=restaurant

# Geo-fenced notifications
POST /api/v1/notifications/geofence
```

### Social Travel Integration
Design APIs to support collaborative travel planning:

```python
# Shared trip management
GET /api/v1/trips/{id}/collaborators
POST /api/v1/trips/{id}/invite

# Social recommendations
GET /api/v1/destinations/{id}/reviews?friends_only=true
GET /api/v1/recommendations?social_boost=true
```

### Real-Time Travel Experience
Support real-time travel scenarios:

```python
# Live booking status
GET /api/v1/bookings/{id}/status
WebSocket: /ws/bookings/{id}

# Real-time location sharing (groups)
WebSocket: /ws/trips/{id}/location

# Live travel alerts
WebSocket: /ws/notifications/travel
```

## API Design Patterns

### Resource-Oriented Design
Model APIs around travel domain resources:

```
/destinations     # Places to visit
/trips           # User travel plans  
/activities      # Things to do
/bookings        # Reservations
/reviews         # User feedback
/recommendations # Personalized suggestions
```

### Hierarchical Resource Relationships
Reflect real-world travel relationships:

```
/trips/{id}/activities              # Activities within a trip
/destinations/{id}/reviews          # Reviews for a destination  
/users/{id}/trips                   # User's trips
/destinations/{id}/similar          # Similar destinations
```

### Progressive Disclosure
Provide summary data by default, detailed data on request:

```python
# Summary view (list)
GET /api/v1/destinations
# Returns: id, name, country, rating, price_level

# Detailed view (individual)  
GET /api/v1/destinations/{id}
# Returns: full details, photos, reviews, nearby attractions

# Custom fields
GET /api/v1/destinations?fields=name,rating,photos
```

## Response Design Philosophy

### Consistent Response Structure
All responses follow a predictable structure:

```json
{
  "data": {}, // or [] for collections
  "meta": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "pagination": {}, // for collections
    "request_id": "req_123456"
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "/api/v1/destinations/123",
    "related": "/api/v1/destinations/123/reviews"
  }
}
```

### Error Response Philosophy
Errors should be helpful for debugging and user experience:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "id": "err_123456",
      "code": "DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND",
      "title": "Destination Not Found",
      "detail": "No destination found with ID '123'",
      "source": {
        "parameter": "id"
      },
      "meta": {
        "suggestion": "Try searching for destinations by name instead"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Principles

### Efficient Data Loading
- **Lazy loading**: Load expensive data only when requested
- **Batch operations**: Support batch requests for mobile apps
- **Compression**: Enable gzip compression for all text responses
- **CDN-friendly**: Design responses to be cacheable by CDN

### Client-First Performance
- **Payload optimization**: Minimize response sizes for various client bandwidth constraints
- **Offline support**: Design APIs to support offline-first client applications
- **Background sync**: Support background data synchronization
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core functionality works with minimal data

## Security Principles

### Zero-Trust Architecture
- **Authenticate everything**: No anonymous endpoints except public data
- **Authorize granularly**: Resource-level and operation-level permissions
- **Validate rigorously**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **Log comprehensively**: Security events and access patterns

### Privacy-First Design
- **Data minimization**: Collect only necessary travel data
- **User control**: APIs for users to manage their data
- **Transparent processing**: Clear data usage in API documentation
- **Geographic compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and regional privacy laws

## Versioning Strategy

### API Lifecycle Management
- **Semantic versioning**: Major.minor.patch for API versions
- **Deprecation policy**: 12-month notice for breaking changes
- **Migration support**: Tools and documentation for version upgrades
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain compatibility within major versions

### Evolution Strategy
```
v1.0: Core travel features (destinations, trips, bookings)
v1.1: Enhanced social features (sharing, collaboration)
v1.2: AI recommendations and personalization
v2.0: Real-time features and WebSocket APIs
```

## Integration Principles

### Third-Party Friendly
- **Webhooks**: Event-driven integrations for booking systems
- **API keys**: Secure access for travel partners
- **Rate limiting**: Fair usage for different integration tiers
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for integration partners

### Internal System Design
- **Microservice-ready**: APIs designed for service decomposition
- **Event-driven**: Support for async processing and notifications
- **Monitoring-friendly**: Structured logging and metrics endpoints
- **Testing-oriented**: APIs designed for comprehensive testing

## Quality Principles

### Reliability
- **Idempotent operations**: Safe to retry critical operations
- **Graceful degradation**: Partial functionality during outages
- **Circuit breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Health checks**: Comprehensive service health monitoring

### Maintainability
- **Self-documenting code**: Clear naming and comprehensive docstrings
- **Automated testing**: Unit, integration, and contract tests
- **Code reviews**: All API changes reviewed for design consistency
- **Documentation syncing**: API docs automatically updated from code

## Monitoring & Analytics

### API Metrics
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Usage patterns**: Popular endpoints, user behavior flows
- **Geographic distribution**: API usage by region and timezone
- **Business metrics**: Conversion rates, booking funnel analytics

### Travel-Specific Analytics
- **Destination popularity**: Trending travel destinations
- **Search patterns**: What users are looking for
- **Booking behavior**: Conversion rates and drop-off points
- **User journey**: End-to-end travel planning analytics
